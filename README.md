# Restaurant Ordering System
This application allows a customer to select and order items from a restaurant menu. It's built in Java, using Swing for the graphical user interface.

# Features
The menu is loaded from a text file, allowing for easy updates and changes to the menu.
The menu items are displayed under their respective categories with their prices.
The customer can select the quantity for each item they want to order.
A summary of the order, including total price, is displayed when the customer is ready to place the order.
The customer has the option to confirm, update, or cancel the order.
If the order is confirmed, the customer is asked to enter their full name and ID number, and the order is saved to a text file. If the order is cancelled, the customer can start a new order.
The application ensures that each order file is unique based on the customer's name and ID number.
